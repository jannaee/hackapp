</ul><p>What is the most fascinating thing I’ve learned in the past month? 
Learning how to build a robot based on the Javascript framework Johnny-Five has been the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned in the past month. I was exposed to a world of robotics programming while attending JSConf2014 this past month. I learned how to develop programs on a SparkCore (an Arduino compatible development board), basic electrical engineering and I learned how to leverage Johnny-Five all for the purpose of building a robot. This is a hobby project that I have been working on and I still have many features to incorporate into my robot. The second version of this robot will include pre-recorded voices and distance sensors. On completion of this project I will have a Javascript powered replica of the television character Johnny-Five from the movie Short Circuit. </p>

<p>What would I like to be doing in the next two years?
My family and I will be moving from Jacksonville, Florida to Raleigh North Carolina this year. Once there, I want to work with one or more startups in visual design and programming. In addition to my job, I would like to continue my work in 3D printing and robotics. I have hopes to create a wearable electronics for either purely aesthetic or useful and functional purposes. </p>

<p>Why I want to go to HackerSchool
I want to go to Hacker school to become a better programmer and to better understand the underpinnings of computer science and development. Although, I am currently employed as a Front End Developer I lack formal CIS training. In 2012 I attended a 12 week code camp at Zappos called Z.code. The experience of working with a group of people excited about coding ignited my passion to program. Most of what I’ve learned about programming since has been self-guided and self-taught. To grow, I need to understand core theories of programming and I view HackerSchool as an ideal opportunity to accomplish this goal. </p>

<p>What would I like to work on at Hacker school?
If I were at Hacker school I would like to either build out a wearable electronic that could help solve a problematic issue for its wearer. Or, I would like to use the Shapeway API, Javascript, HTML and CSS to build a custom API for the design and customization of my Great Dane jewelry. The project will require me to build an easily consumed API, program more math than I’m used to, and program at a larger scale than I’ve done to date. This project is inspired by Shapeways 3D ring creator, which I have used to build/buy a custom ring. </p>

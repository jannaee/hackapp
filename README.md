Planned updates for the projects within this repo include

Crackle Pop 
- Future plans include displaying in animated svg (maybe snap or raphael) pop corn that will snap and pop

Rock Paper Scissors Game
- Would like to add some audio cues for players and to get a chance to experiment with HTML5 audio
- Would like to use my own illustrations for the hands
- Smooth out the clunkiness of code with CSS transitions.

Thanks!

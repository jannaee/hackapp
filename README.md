Thank you for visiting my Hacker School Application page. Below you will find my answers to questions asked of applicants that are interested in applying for admission into [hackerschool](www.hackerschool.com/apply). After perusing these answers feel free to visit my [personal website](http://www.jannaee.com) or [browse around github](http://www.github.com/jannaee).

### Crackle Pop
* This program prints out 'crackle' for numbers divisible by 3, 'pop' for numbers divisible by 5 and 'cracklepop' for numbers divisible by both
* Intended updates for this project include creating and animating a svg of popcorn using snap svg or raphael.js
* [View](https://github.com/jannaee/hackapp/blob/master/cracklepop-final.html) the code here

### Rock Paper Scissors Game
* This is a game that I built from scratch that simulates a game of Rock Paper Scissors.
* I would like to add some audio cues for players and to get a chance to experiment with HTML5 audio
* Would like to use my own illustrations for the hands
* Smooth out the clunkiness of code with CSS transitions.

(Update: I originally started this application in the month of June for consideration of a July/August enrollment. However, due to a family loss I took a break from programming and consequently postponed submitting this application. My family and I used the past month to recoup from our loss and as a result I have made very little modifications to this application since it's completion in June. Despite this lull, I believe the following responses are still relevant and demonstrative of my enthusiasm in programming.) 

### The most fascinating thing that I’ve learned in the past month
Learning how to build a robot based on the Javascript framework Johnny-Five has been the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned in the past month. I was exposed to a world of robotics programming while attending JSConf2014. I learned how to develop programs on a SparkCore (an Arduino compatible development board), basic electrical engineering and I learned how to leverage Johnny-Five all for the purpose of building a robot. This is a hobby project that I have been working on and I still have many features to incorporate into my robot. The second version of this robot will include pre-recorded voices and distance sensors. On completion of this project I will have a Javascript powered replica of the television character Johnny-Five from the movie Short Circuit. 

### My plans for the next to two years
My family and I will be moving from Jacksonville, Florida to Raleigh North Carolina this year. Once there, I want to work with one or more startups in visual design and programming. In addition to my job, I would like to continue my work in 3D printing and robotics. I have hopes to create a wearable electronics for either purely aesthetic or useful and functional purposes. 

### The reason why I want to go to Hackerschool
I want to go to Hacker school to become a better programmer and to better understand the underpinnings of computer science and development. Although, I am currently a freelance Front End Developer I lack formal CIS training. In 2012 I attended a 12 week code camp at Zappos called Z.code. The experience of working with a group of people excited about coding ignited my passion to program. Most of what I’ve learned about programming since has been self-guided and self-taught. To grow, I need to understand core theories of programming and I view HackerSchool as an ideal opportunity to accomplish this goal. 
 
### Projects I'd hope to work on while attending Hackerschool
If I were at Hackerschool I would like to either build out a wearable electronic that could help solve a problematic issue for its wearer. Or, I would like to use the Shapeway API, Javascript, HTML and CSS to build a custom API for the design and customization of my Great Dane jewelry. The project will require me to build an easily consumed API, program more math than I’m used to, and program at a larger scale than I’ve done to date. This project is inspired by Shapeways 3D ring creator, which I have used to build/buy a custom ring. 

### My programming background
My backgrond and degree is in Fine Arts with a focus in Graphic Design. I have spent over 12 years evolving from a graphic designer to web designer into front end developer. It wasn't until 2012 that I began teaching myself how to program with Javascript via online resources and enrolling into Zappos' pilot developer bootcamp. This year, after attending my first Robotics hackathon at JSCONF, I have discovered that I would like to specifically use Javascript to power physical devices. However, my skills need much improving and since I have no formal training am really hopeful to be exposed to students who have formal CIS training.
